# Blockframes


## Working with nx

```bash
# nvm use v9.10
ng generate @nrwl/schematics:node-application catalog-marketplace
# directory: leave empty
# tags: leave empty
```

### Issues regarding application creation

https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/1104


## Environments

Environments variables are used to adapt the application to different execution environment.
The main environments to be aware of are: local development, continuous integration, staging and production.

Each app uses its own `environment/` folder. Shared environments are stored in the root `/env` folder.

## Setup


### Prep your environment

```bash
# Copy the template into your env local dev env:
cp ./env/env.template.ts ./env/env.ts
# Then edit it with your values.
```

### Setup the authentication

- In the firebase console, authentication, enable the email / password auth.
- Create a service account to use the admin locally.

```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=some/path/service-account-for-your-firebase.json
```

### Setup your secrets

```sh
export SENDGRID_API_KEY=""
export MNEMONIC=""
```

## Running and testing

```bash
npm run start # starts your server in dev mode, hmr, etc
npm run e2e:dev # starts cypress when your server is already running
npm run lint, npm run test, etc. # check this in your package.json
```


## Deploy

```bash
npm run build:all
firebase deploy
```

## Data

### Cloud Storage:

We upload IP documents to the default bucket at path:
`/ip/{ipID}/version/{versionID}`


### Firestore:

We store ip documents version in:

`/ip/{ipID}/version/{versionID}`

We de-normalize the hash at:
`/hash/{documentHash}`

This lets us find the original document (`{ipID, versionID}`)
when a Timestamp event is received from the blockchain.

*Setup:* in your firebase console, hosting section,
create a bucket called `blockframes-backups` for the backup functions.

### CORS policy

Install gcloud
```
# Example for Linux :
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
gcloud init
# For other OS see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install
```

Create a file named `cors.json` with:
```
[
    {
      "origin": ["*"],
      "method": ["GET"],
      "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
    }
]
```

Push this file with `gsutil`
```
#https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/download-files
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://blockframes-vincent.appspot.com
rm cors.json
```

## eth-events-server

### Notes

For each `{contractName: addresse}` in the environment,
the service will listen to every events and push their content
to a pubsub topic named: `{topicRootName}.{contractName}`.

Something like: `eth-events-server.ScriptHash`

### Setup

In your gcloud project,

Create a service account, with roles:

- pubsub edit (publish messages)
- pubsub edit (manage topics)

Download the keys and export an `env` variable that points to your json key

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./blockframes-laurent-230215-ccf4f1949393.json
```

### Build & Run with Docker

```bash
ng build eth-events-server
docker build . --tag=eth-events-server:0.0.1
docker run -v ${PWD}/blockframes-laurent-702feef93c99.json:/app/creds.json \
    --rm -p 3333 -t -i eth-events-server:0.0.1
```
